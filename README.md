Ever wanted to get a better grasp on the Teamfight Tactics meta? Look no further!

Four-Two is the first intelligent Teamfight Tactics practice tool, allowing you to generate realistic, in-game scenarios and test your ability to find the optimal lines. Most importantly, after you complete a rolldown, Four-Two will show potential optimizations you could have made in item choices and team composition based on what you encountered in game.

Four-Two can be played [here](victorhli404.github.io/Four-Two/).

If you're interested in how Four-Two generates statistics for the player, you can take a look at [this project](https://github.com/VictorHLi404/TFT-Database-Builder), a custom C# database builder and APi project that provides granular information on the state of the database.
